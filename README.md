# Deep Search Bible

This is the first iteration of the deep search bible. At this point it doesn't do anything special. Just prints books of the bible to the screen.

In the immediate future I'm planning on adding:
* The ability to search through chapters, books, or the whole bible.
* Having two passages or versions at the same time.
* Notate either a verse, passage or book.
* Chain Referencing

To use simply click the book menu in the top left corner, and release when on the desired book.
